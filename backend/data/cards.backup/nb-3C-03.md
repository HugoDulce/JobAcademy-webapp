# nb-3C-03

START
What is the time complexity of GaussianNB training and prediction?
END

START
Training: O(nd)
- n = samples, d = features
- One pass through data to compute means/variances
- No iterations, no matrix inversions

Prediction: O(ncd)
- n = test samples, c = classes, d = features
- For each sample: compute c class scores
- Each score: d feature probabilities

Why fast: Linear in everything. Compare to SVM O(n²d) or neural nets with backprop.
