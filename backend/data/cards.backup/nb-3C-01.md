# nb-3C-01

START
Describe the Naive Bayes algorithm in 3 steps.
END

START
Step 1: Compute priors
P(y = c) = count(c) / total_samples

Step 2: Compute likelihoods
P(xᵢ | y = c) for each feature given each class

Step 3: Classify via Bayes' rule
ŷ = argmax_c [P(y = c) × ∏ᵢ P(xᵢ | y = c)]

Pick the class with highest posterior probability.
