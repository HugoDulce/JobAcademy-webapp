# nb-4M-01b

START
What are the MLE solutions for Naive Bayes parameters?
END

START
Prior: P(y = c) = nᶜ / n (class frequency)

Mean: μᶜᵢ = average of feature i in class c

Variance: σ²ᶜᵢ = variance of feature i in class c

These are the maximum likelihood estimates — values that make the observed data most probable under the model.

Why it works: Gaussian likelihood is convex, derivatives have closed-form solutions.
