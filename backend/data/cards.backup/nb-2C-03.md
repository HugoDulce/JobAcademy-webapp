# nb-2C-03

START
What does GaussianNB's var_smoothing parameter do?
END

START
Prevents zero-variance crashes by adding a small constant to all variances.

var_smoothed = var + (max_var × var_smoothing)

Default: 1e-9

Why needed: If a feature has zero variance in training (constant value), prediction breaks. Smoothing ensures all variances are positive.

Tradeoff: Too high = underfit (assumes more noise than exists), too low = numerical instability.
END
