# nb-1C-03

START
Give 3 real-world applications where Naive Bayes excels.
END

START
1. Email spam filtering — bag-of-words features are high-dim and mostly independent

2. Sentiment analysis — word presence/absence predicts sentiment class

3. Real-time content recommendation — extremely fast inference, can handle millions of users

All exploit NB's strengths: high dimensions, sparse features, speed, independence assumption roughly holds.
