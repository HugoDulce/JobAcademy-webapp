# nb-2C-01

START
What is the core data assumption Naive Bayes makes?
END

START
Conditional independence given the class label.

P(x₁, x₂, …, xₙ | y) = ∏ᵢ P(xᵢ | y)

Reading: "The joint probability of all features given the class equals the product of each feature's individual probability given the class."

Each feature contributes evidence independently, therefore the joint factors into a simple product.
