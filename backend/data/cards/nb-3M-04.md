# nb-3M-04

START
Write the likelihood formula for MultinomialNB.
END

START
P(xᵢ | y = c) = (count(xᵢ, c) + α) / (∑ⱼ count(xⱼ, c) + α × n_features)

Where:
- count(xᵢ, c) = times feature i appears in class c
- α = smoothing parameter (default 1.0, Laplace smoothing)
- Denominator = total feature counts in class c

Why smoothing: Prevents P(xᵢ|c) = 0 for unseen features.
