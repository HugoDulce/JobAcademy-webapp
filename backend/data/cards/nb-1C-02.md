# nb-1C-02

START
When would you choose Naive Bayes over Logistic Regression?
END

START
Choose NB when:
- High dimensionality (d >> n)
- Features roughly independent
- Need extreme speed
- Text/sparse data

Choose LogReg when:
- Need calibrated probabilities
- Features interact
- Want interpretable coefficients
- Have enough data (n > d)

Rule of thumb: NB for quick baselines and text, LogReg for production models.
END
