# nb-5M-01

START
Complete the log loss formula:

Log Loss = -1/n ∑ [ ___ ]
END

START
Log Loss = -1/n ∑ [ y log(ŷ) + (1-y) log(1-ŷ) ]

Where:
- y = true label (0 or 1)
- ŷ = predicted probability

Penalizes: Confident wrong predictions heavily.

Example: If y=1 and ŷ=0.01, log(0.01) = -4.6 → huge penalty
END
