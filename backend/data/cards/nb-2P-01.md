# nb-2P-01

START
Write code to split data for NB with proper stratification.
END

START
python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, 
    test_size=0.2, 
    stratify=y,  # Maintains class distribution
    random_state=42
)


Why stratify: NB is sensitive to class imbalance. Stratification ensures train/test have same class proportions as original data.

When to skip: Perfectly balanced classes, or time-series data where you can't shuffle.
