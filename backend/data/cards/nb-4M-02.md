# nb-4M-02

START
Derive the MLE for μ in GaussianNB. Start with log-likelihood, take derivative, set to zero.
END

START
Start: 
log L = ∑ₙ -(½/σ²)(xₙ - μ)² + const

Derivative:
∂/∂μ log L = ∑ₙ (xₙ - μ) / σ²

Set to zero:
∑ₙ (xₙ - μ) = 0
∑ xₙ = nμ

Solution:
μ = (∑ xₙ) / n = sample mean

The MLE for Gaussian mean is the arithmetic average.
