# nb-3C-02

START
Why does Naive Bayes use log probabilities instead of raw probabilities?
END

START
Numerical underflow prevention.

Multiplying many small probabilities (e.g., P(xᵢ|y) = 0.01) causes underflow — result rounds to zero.

Solution: Work in log space
log(a × b) = log(a) + log(b)

Sum of logs instead of product of probabilities.

Example:
0.01 × 0.01 × ... (100 times) = 10⁻²⁰⁰ → underflow
log(0.01) + log(0.01) + ... (100 times) = -200 → stable
