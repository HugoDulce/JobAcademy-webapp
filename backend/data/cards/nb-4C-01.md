# nb-4C-01

START
What does Naive Bayes fit() actually compute? No formulas.
END

START
Counting and averaging. Three statistics per class:

1. Class frequency (prior) — count samples
2. Feature means — average each feature within class
3. Feature variances — spread of each feature within class

No iteration, no gradient descent. One pass through the data, therefore training is O(nd) where n=samples, d=features.
END
