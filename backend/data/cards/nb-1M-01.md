# nb-1M-01

START
Complete Bayes' theorem:

P(y | x) = ___
END

START
P(y | x) = [ P(x | y) × P(y) ] / P(x)

Where:
- P(y | x) = posterior (what we want)
- P(x | y) = likelihood (what NB models)
- P(y) = prior (class frequency)
- P(x) = evidence (normalizing constant)

NB ignores P(x) for classification (same for all classes).
END
