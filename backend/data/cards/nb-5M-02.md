# nb-5M-02

START
Two NB models:
Model A: Accuracy=0.92, Log Loss=0.35
Model B: Accuracy=0.89, Log Loss=0.18

Which is better? Why?
END

START
Depends on your goal:

Choose A if: You only care about correct classifications (rank-ordering)

Choose B if: You use predicted probabilities for decisions

Model B is better calibrated (lower log loss) even though slightly less accurate. Its probabilities are more trustworthy.

Insight: Accuracy measures threshold decision, log loss measures probability quality.
